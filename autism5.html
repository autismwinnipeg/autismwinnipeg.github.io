    <p>Research into the causes, the diagnosis, and the treatment of autism
spectrum disorders has advanced in tandem. With new well-researched
standardized diagnostic tools, ASD can be diagnosed at an early age. And
with early diagnosis, the treatments found to be beneficial in recent
years can be used to help the child with ASD develop to his or her
greatest potential.</p>

<p>In the past few years, there has been public interest in a theory that
suggested a link between the use of thimerosal, a mercury-based
preservative used in the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine, and
autism. Although mercury is no longer found in childhood vaccines in the
United States, some parents still have concerns about vaccinations. Many
well-done, large-scale studies have now been done that have failed to
show a link between thimerosal and autism. A panel from the Institute of
Medicine is now examining these studies, including a large Danish study
that concluded that there was no causal relationship between childhood
vaccination using thimerosal-containing vaccines and the development of
an autism spectrum disorder, 27 and a U.S. study looking at exposure to
mercury, lead, and other heavy metals.</p>

<p><strong>Research on the Biologic Basis of ASD</strong></p>

<p>Because of its relative inaccessibility, scientists have only recently
been able to study the brain systematically. But with the emergence of
new brain imaging tools-computerized tomography (CT), positron emission
tomography (PET), single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT),
and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), study of the structure and the
functioning of the brain can be done. With the aid of modern technology
and the new availability of both normal and autism tissue samples to do
postmortem studies, researchers will be able to learn much through
comparative studies.</p>

<p>Postmortem and MRI studies have shown that many major brain structures
are implicated in autism. This includes the cerebellum, cerebral cortex,
limbic system, corpus callosum, basal ganglia, and brain stem. 28 Other
research is focusing on the role of neurotransmitters such as serotonin,
dopamine, and epinephrine.</p>

<p><strong>Image of major brain structures implicated in autism</strong></p>

<p>Research into the causes of autism spectrum disorders is being fueled by
other recent developments. Evidence points to genetic factors playing a
prominent role in the causes for ASD. Twin and family studies have
suggested an underlying genetic vulnerability to ASD. 29 To further
research in this field, the Autism Genetic Resource Exchange, a project
initiated by the Cure Autism Now Foundation, and aided by an NIMH grant,
is recruiting genetic samples from several hundred families. Each family
with more than one member diagnosed with ASD is given a 2-hour, in-home
screening. With a large number of DNA samples, it is hoped that the most
important genes will be found. This will enable scientists to learn what
the culprit genes do and how they can go wrong.</p>

<p>Another exciting development is the <a href="http://www.brainbank.org">Autism Tissue
Program</a>, supported by the Autism Society of
America Foundation, the Medical Investigation of Neurodevelopmental
Disorders (M.I.N.D.) Institute at the University of California, Davis,
and the National Alliance for Autism Research. The program is aided by a
grant to the <a href="http://www.brainbank.mclean.org">Harvard Brain and Tissue Resource
Center</a>, funded by the National
Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) and the National Institute of
Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS). Studies of the postmortem
brain with imaging methods will help us learn why some brains are large,
how the limbic system develops, and how the brain changes as it ages.
Tissue samples can be stained and will show which neurotransmitters are
being made in the cells and how they are transported and released to
other cells. By focusing on specific brain regions and
neurotransmitters, it will become easier to identify susceptibility
genes.</p>

<p><strong>Recent neuroimaging studies have shown that a contributing cause for
autism may be abnormal brain development beginning in the infant’s first
months.</strong> This “growth dysregulation hypothesis” holds that the
anatomical abnormalities seen in autism are caused by genetic defects in
brain growth factors. It is possible that sudden, rapid head growth in
an infant may be an early warning signal that will lead to early
diagnosis and effective biological intervention or possible prevention
of autism. 30</p>

<p><strong>The Children’s Health Act of 2000-What It Means to Autism Research</strong></p>

<p>The Children’s Health Act of 2000 was responsible for the creation of
the Interagency Autism Coordinating Committee (IACC), a committee that
includes the directors of five NIH institutes-the National Institute of
Mental Health, the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and
Stroke, the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication
Disorders (NIDCD), the National Institute of Child Health and Human
Development (NICHD), and the National Institute of Environmental Health
Sciences (NIEHS)-as well as representatives from the Health Resource
Services Administration, the National Center on Birth Defects and
Developmental Disabilities (a part of the Centers for Disease Control),
the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, the Substance
Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, the Administration on
Developmental Disabilities, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid
Services, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and the U.S. Department
of Education. The Committee, instructed by the Congress to develop a
10-year agenda for autism research, introduced the plan, dubbed a
“matrix” or a “roadmap,” at the first Autism Summit Conference in
November 2003. The roadmap indicates priorities for research for years 1
to 3, years 4 to 6, and years 7 to 10.</p>

<p>The five NIH institutes of the IACC have established the Studies to
Advance Autism Research and Treatment (STAART) Network, composed of
eight network centers. They will conduct research in the fields of
developmental neurobiology, genetics, and psychopharmacology. Each
center is pursuing its own particular mix of studies, but there also
will be multi-site clinical trials within the STAART network.</p>

<p><strong>The STAART centers are located at the following sites:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill</li>
  <li>Yale University, Connecticut</li>
  <li>University of Washington, Seattle</li>
  <li>University of California, Los Angeles</li>
  <li>Mount Sinai Medical School, New York</li>
  <li>Kennedy Krieger Institute, Maryland</li>
  <li>Boston University, Massachusetts</li>
  <li>University of Rochester, New York</li>
</ul>

<p>A data coordination center will analyze the data generated by both the
STAART network and the Collaborative Programs of Excellence in Autism
(CPEA). This latter program, funded by the NICHD and the NIDCD Network
on the Neurobiology and Genetics of Autism, consists of 10 sites. The
CPEA is at present studying the world’s largest group of well-diagnosed
individuals with autism characterized by genetic and developmental
profiles.</p>

<p><strong>The CPEA centers are located at:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Boston University, Massachusetts</li>
  <li>University of California, Davis</li>
  <li>University of California, Irvine</li>
  <li>University of California, Los Angeles</li>
  <li>Yale University, Connecticut</li>
  <li>University of Washington, Seattle</li>
  <li>University of Rochester, New York</li>
  <li>University of Texas, Houston</li>
  <li>University of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania</li>
  <li>University of Utah, Salt Lake City</li>
</ul>

<p>The NIEHS has programs at:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Center for Childhood Neurotoxicology and Assessment, University of
Medicine &amp; Dentistry, New Jersey * The Center for the Study of
Environmental Factors in the Etiology of Autism, University of
California, Davis</li>
</ul>
