    <p>Not until the middle of the twentieth century was there a name for a
disorder that now appears to affect an estimated one of every five
hundred children, a disorder that causes disruption in families and
unfulfilled lives for many children. In 1943 Dr. Leo Kanner of the Johns
Hopkins Hospital studied a group of 11 children and introduced the label
early infantile autism into the English language. At the same time a
German scientist, Dr. Hans Asperger, described a milder form of the
disorder that became known as Asperger syndrome. Thus these two
disorders were described and are today listed in the Diagnostic and
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders DSM-IV-TR (fourth edition, text
revision) 1 as two of the five pervasive developmental disorders (PDD),
more often referred to today as autism spectrum disorders (ASD). All
these disorders are characterized by varying degrees of impairment in
communication skills, social interactions, and restricted, repetitive
and stereotyped patterns of behavior.</p>

<p><strong>The autism spectrum disorders can often be reliably detected by the
age of 3 years</strong>, and in some cases as early as 18 months. 2 Studies
suggest that many children eventually may be accurately identified by
the age of 1 year or even younger. The appearance of any of the warning
signs of ASD is reason to have a child evaluated by a professional
specializing in these disorders.</p>

<p><strong>Parents are usually the first to notice unusual behaviors in their
child.</strong> In some cases, the baby seemed “different” from birth,
unresponsive to people or focusing intently on one item for long periods
of time. The first signs of an ASD can also appear in children who seem
to have been developing normally. When an engaging, babbling toddler
suddenly becomes silent, withdrawn, self-abusive, or indifferent to
social overtures, something is wrong. Research has shown that parents
are usually correct about noticing developmental problems, although they
may not realize the specific nature or degree of the problem.</p>

<p>The pervasive developmental disorders, or autism spectrum disorders,
range from a severe form, called autistic disorder, to a milder form,
Asperger syndrome. If a child has symptoms of either of these disorders,
but does not meet the specific criteria for either, the diagnosis is
called pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified
(PDD-NOS). Other rare, very severe disorders that are included in the
autism spectrum disorders are Rett syndrome and childhood disintegrative
disorder. This brochure will focus on classic autism, PDD-NOS, and
Asperger syndrome, with brief descriptions of Rett syndrome and
childhood disintegrative disorder on the following page.</p>

<p><strong>Rare Autism Spectrum Disorders</strong>                                     <br />
<strong>Rett Syndrome</strong></p>

<p>Rett syndrome is relatively rare, affecting almost exclusively females,one out of 10,000 to 15,000. After a period of normal development,  sometime between 6 and 18 months, autism-like symptoms begin to appear.The little girl’s mental and social development regresses-she no longerresponds to her parents and pulls away from any social contact. If she has been talking, she stops; she cannot control her feet; she wrings her hands. Some of the problems associated with Rett syndrome can be treated. Physical, occupational, and speech therapy can help with problems of coordination, movement, and speech.</p>

<p>Scientists sponsored by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development have discovered that a mutation in the sequence of a singlegene can cause Rett syndrome. This discovery may help doctors slow or  stop the progress of the syndrome. It may also lead to methods of screening for Rett syndrome, thus enabling doctors to start treating   these children much sooner, and improving the quality of life these children experience.</p>

<p><strong>Childhood Disintegrative Disorder</strong></p>

<p>Very few children who have an autism spectrum disorder (ASD) diagnosis meet the criteria for childhood disintegrative disorder (CDD). An estimate based on four surveys of ASD found fewer than two children per 100,000 with ASD could be classified as having CDD. This suggests that CDD is a very rare form of ASD. It has a strong male preponderance. Symptoms may appear by age 2, but the average age of onset is between 3
and 4 years. Until this time, the child has age-appropriate skills in  communication and social relationships. The long period of normal  development before regression helps differentiate CDD from Rett    syndrome.</p>

<p>The loss of such skills as vocabulary are more dramatic in CDD than they 
are in classical autism. The diagnosis requires extensive and pronounced 
losses involving motor, language, and social skills. CDD is also accompanied by loss of bowel and bladder control and oftentimes seizures 
and a very low IQ.</p>
