    <p>Medications are often used to treat behavioral problems, such as
aggression, self-injurious behavior, and severe tantrums, that keep the
person with ASD from functioning more effectively at home or school. The
medications used are those that have been developed to treat similar
symptoms in other disorders. Many of these medications are prescribed
“off-label.” This means they have not been officially approved by the
FDA for use in children, but the doctor prescribes the medications if he
or she feels they are appropriate for your child. Further research needs
to be done to ensure not only the efficacy but the safety of
psychotropic agents used in the treatment of children and adolescents.</p>

<p><strong>A child with ASD may not respond in the same way to medications as
typically developing children.</strong>It is important that parents work with a
doctor who has experience with children with autism. A child should be
monitored closely while taking a medication. The doctor will prescribe
the lowest dose possible to be effective. Ask the doctor about any side
effects the medication may have and keep a record of how your child
responds to the medication. It will be helpful to read the “patient
insert” that comes with your child’s medication. Some people keep the
patient inserts in a small notebook to be used as a reference. This is
most useful when several medications are prescribed.</p>

<p><strong>Anxiety and depression.</strong>The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors
(SSRI’s) are the medications most often prescribed for symptoms of
anxiety, depression, and/or obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Only
one of the SSRI’s, <strong>fluoxetine, (Prozac)</strong></p>
