<p>Thimerosal is a preservative that is added to vaccines (has been since the 1930s) that is almost half (49.6% by weight) mercury. Preservatives are added to vaccines to prevent bacteria and fungi from growing. These vaccines include antivenins, skin test antigens, ophthalmic and nasal products. Thimerosal preserved vaccines have been given to children as well as adults.</p>

<p>The FDA department CBER (Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research) found that in more than 30 vaccines Americans are given the EPA established limit for mercury intake in the first 6 months of live was exceeded by up to 30-50 times. Mercury causes such concern because it is the second most toxic element on earth and has been known to cause learning disabilities, autism, Alzheimerâ€™s, multiple sclerosis (MS), fibromyalgia, lupus, arthritis, depression, and bipolar disorder. Even seemingly small amounts of mercury have major, deadly consequences and mercury poisoning affects the kidneys and the nervous system. Other effects of mercury poisoning include burning feeling in the limbs, mental side effects such as loss of memory, vision and hearing, other psychological effects, paralysis, congenital malformations, kidney failure, and even death.</p>

<p>The continued use of mercury based preservatives in vaccines is dangerous and drug companies know it. However, instead of removing the mercury, some have used 30 to 50 times as much as the EPA set for the highest limit. It is especially dangerous to the developing brain of a child, and in 22 years the number of children diagnosed with autism (which has been shown to reflect amounts of mercury preservatives in vaccines given in the first 18 months of life) rose from 1 autistic child out of every 10,000 to 1 autistic child out of every 250. Eli Lilly, the manufacturer of Thimerosal, has been taken to trial with hundreds of lawsuits. If your child has mercury induced autism, you could be entitled to pursue a lawsuit.
