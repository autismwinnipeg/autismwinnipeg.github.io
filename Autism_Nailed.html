    <p><strong>By: Doctor Edward C Hamlyn MBChB</strong></p>

<p>For anyone concerned as to the reason for autism, it should now be known, that autism is caused by a neurotoxin used as a preservative during immunisation.</p>

<p>Injections for babies and youngsters, to protect them against mumps, measles, whooping cough, diphtheria, tetanus, rubella, hepatitis, meningitis etc contain mercury in the form of thimerosal, which is a known nerve poison. It is most toxic to the growing brain. The younger the brain, the worse the damage.</p>

<p>The danger of mercury contained in thimerosal was suspected by the drug industry even before it was so used. Mercury has always been known to cause trouble. Mercury was used in the creation of felt for hats and hence the Mad Hatters and their tea-party.</p>

<p>When I was a boy, a condition in babies called Pink Disease, was found to be due to calomel used as a teething powder. Those babies were exceedingly irritable.</p>

<p>Economic pressures and the desire to profit from the opportunity to create immunity, silenced all pleas for caution. Mercury was used in injections with gay abandon.</p>

<p>As an epidemic of autism became apparent, the vaccines were sent off to a third estate of man and China now has 1.8 million children with autism. Sooner or later this well-kept secret will become common knowledge and then revenge against the West in the form of run away terrorism, will be upon us.</p>

<p>It may not be too late, to wake up and notice the dreadful problems created by an absence of ethics from the subject of economics.</p>
