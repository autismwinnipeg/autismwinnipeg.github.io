    <p><strong>The autism spectrum disorders are more common in the pediatric
population than are some better known disorders such as diabetes, spinal
bifida, or Down syndrome.</strong> 2 Prevalence studies have been done in
several states and also in the United Kingdom, Europe, and Asia.
Prevalence estimates range from 2 to 6 per 1,000 children. This wide
range of prevalence points to a need for earlier and more accurate
screening for the symptoms of ASD. The earlier the disorder is
diagnosed, the sooner the child can be helped through treatment
interventions. Pediatricians, family physicians, daycare providers,
teachers, and parents may initially dismiss signs of ASD, optimistically
thinking the child is just a little slow and will “catch up.” Although
early intervention has a dramatic impact on reducing symptoms and
increasing a child’s ability to grow and learn new skills, it is
estimated that only 50 percent of children are diagnosed before
kindergarten.</p>

<p><strong>All children with ASD demonstrate deficits in 1) social interaction,
2) verbal and nonverbal communication, and 3) repetitive behaviors or
interests.</strong> In addition, they will often have unusual responses to
sensory experiences, such as certain sounds or the way objects look.
Each of these symptoms runs the gamut from mild to severe. They will
present in each individual child differently. For instance, a child may
have little trouble learning to read but exhibit extremely poor social
interaction. Each child will display communication, social, and
behavioral patterns that are individual but fit into the overall
diagnosis of ASD.</p>

<p>Children with ASD do not follow the typical patterns of child
development. In some children, hints of future problems may be apparent
from birth. In most cases, the problems in communication and social
skills become more noticeable as the child lags further behind other
children the same age. Some other children start off well enough.
Oftentimes between 12 and 36 months old, the differences in the way they
react to people and other unusual behaviors become apparent. Some
parents report the change as being sudden, and that their children start
to reject people, act strangely, and lose language and social skills
they had previously acquired. In other cases, there is a plateau, or
leveling, of progress so that the difference between the child with
autism and other children the same age becomes more noticeable.</p>

<p>ASD is defined by a certain set of behaviors that can range from the
very mild to the severe. The following possible indicators of ASD were
identified on the Public Health Training Network Webcast, Autism Among
Us. 3</p>

<p><strong>Possible Indicators of Autism Spectrum Disorders</strong></p>

<p>Does not babble, point, or make meaningful gestures by 1 year of age</p>

<ul>
  <li>Does not speak one word by 16 months</li>
  <li>Does not combine two words by 2 years</li>
  <li>Does not respond to name</li>
  <li>Loses language or social skills</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Some Other Indicators</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Poor eye contact</li>
  <li>Doesn’t seem to know how to play with toys</li>
  <li>Excessively lines up toys or other objects</li>
  <li>Is attached to one particular toy or object</li>
  <li>Doesn’t smile</li>
  <li>At times seems to be hearing impaired</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Social Symptoms</strong></p>

<p>From the start, typically developing infants are social beings. Early in
life, they gaze at people, turn toward voices, grasp a finger, and even
smile.</p>

<p>In contrast, <strong>most children with ASD seem to have tremendous difficulty
learning to engage in the give-and-take of everyday human interaction.</strong>
Even in the first few months of life, many do not interact and they
avoid eye contact. They seem indifferent to other people, and often seem
to prefer being alone. They may resist attention or passively accept
hugs and cuddling. Later, they seldom seek comfort or respond to
parents’ displays of anger or affection in a typical way. Research has
suggested that although children with ASD are attached to their parents,
their expression of this attachment is unusual and difficult to “read.”
To parents, it may seem as if their child is not attached at all.
Parents who looked forward to the joys of cuddling, teaching, and
playing with their child may feel crushed by this lack of the expected
and typical attachment behavior.</p>

<p><strong>Children with ASD also are slower in learning to interpret what others
are thinking and feeling.</strong> Subtle social cues-whether a smile, a wink,
or a grimace-may have little meaning. To a child who misses these cues,
“Come here” always means the same thing, whether the speaker is smiling
and extending her arms for a hug or frowning and planting her fists on
her hips. Without the ability to interpret gestures and facial
expressions, the social world may seem bewildering. To compound the
problem, people with ASD have difficulty seeing things from another
person’s perspective. Most 5-year-olds understand that other people have
different information, feelings, and goals than they have. A person with
ASD may lack such understanding. This inability leaves them unable to
predict or understand other people’s actions.</p>

<p>Although not universal, <strong>it is common for people with ASD also to have
difficulty regulating their emotions.</strong> This can take the form of
“immature” behavior such as crying in class or verbal outbursts that
seem inappropriate to those around them. The individual with ASD might
also be disruptive and physically aggressive at times, making social
relationships still more difficult. They have a tendency to “lose
control,” particularly when they’re in a strange or overwhelming
environment, or when angry and frustrated. They may at times break
things, attack others, or hurt themselves. In their frustration, some
bang their heads, pull their hair, or bite their arms.</p>

<p><strong>Communication Difficulties</strong></p>

<p>By age 3, most children have passed predictable milestones on the path
to learning language; one of the earliest is babbling. By the first
birthday, a typical toddler says words, turns when he hears his name,
points when he wants a toy, and when offered something distasteful,
makes it clear that the answer is “no.”</p>

<p><strong>Some children diagnosed with ASD remain mute throughout their
lives.</strong>Some infants who later show signs of ASD coo and babble during
the first few months of life, but they soon stop. Others may be delayed,
developing language as late as age 5 to 9. Some children may learn to
use communication systems such as pictures or sign language.</p>

<p>Those who do speak often use language in unusual ways. They seem unable
to combine words into meaningful sentences. Some speak only single
words, while others repeat the same phrase over and over. Some ASD
children parrot what they hear, a condition called echolalia. Although
many children with no ASD go through a stage where they repeat what they
hear, it normally passes by the time they are 3.</p>

<p><strong>Some children only mildly affected may exhibit slight delays in
language</strong>, or even seem to have precocious language and unusually large
vocabularies, but have great difficulty in sustaining a conversation.
The “give and take” of normal conversation is hard for them, although
they often carry on a monologue on a favorite subject, giving no one
else an opportunity to comment. Another difficulty is often the
inability to understand body language, tone of voice, or “phrases of
speech.” They might interpret a sarcastic expression such as “Oh, that’s
just great” as meaning it really IS great.</p>

<p>While it can be hard to understand what ASD children are saying, <strong>their
body language is also difficult to understand</strong>. Facial expressions,
movements, and gestures rarely match what they are saying. Also, their
tone of voice fails to reflect their feelings. A high-pitched,
sing-song, or flat, robot-like voice is common. Some children with
relatively good language skills speak like little adults, failing to
pick up on the “kid-speak” that is common in their peers.</p>

<p>Without meaningful gestures or the language to ask for things, people
with ASD are at a loss to let others know what they need. As a result,
they may simply scream or grab what they want. Until they are taught
better ways to express their needs, ASD children do whatever they can to
get through to others. As people with ASD grow up, they can become
increasingly aware of their difficulties in understanding others and in
being understood. As a result they may become anxious or depressed.</p>

<p><strong>Repetitive Behaviors</strong></p>

<p>Although children with ASD usually appear physically normal and have
good muscle control, odd repetitive motions may set them off from other
children. These behaviors might be extreme and highly apparent or more
subtle. Some children and older individuals spend a lot of time
repeatedly flapping their arms or walking on their toes. Some suddenly
freeze in position.</p>

<p><strong>As children, they might spend hours lining up their cars and trains in
a certain way</strong>, rather than using them for pretend play. If someone
accidentally moves one of the toys, the child may be tremendously upset.
ASD children need, and demand, absolute consistency in their
environment. A slight change in any routine-in mealtimes, dressing,
taking a bath, going to school at a certain time and by the same
route-can be extremely disturbing. Perhaps order and sameness lend some
stability in a world of confusion.</p>

<p>Repetitive behavior sometimes takes the form of a persistent, intense
preoccupation. For example, the child might be obsessed with learning
all about vacuum cleaners, train schedules, or lighthouses. Often there
is great interest in numbers, symbols, or science topics.</p>

<p><strong>Problems That May Accompany ASD</strong></p>

<p><strong>Sensory problems.</strong> When children’s perceptions are accurate, they can
learn from what they see, feel, or hear. On the other hand, if sensory
information is faulty, the child’s experiences of the world can be
confusing. Many ASD children are highly attuned or even painfully
sensitive to certain sounds, textures, tastes, and smells. Some children
find the feel of clothes touching their skin almost unbearable. Some
sounds-a vacuum cleaner, a ringing telephone, a sudden storm, even the
sound of waves lapping the shoreline-will cause these children to cover
their ears and scream.</p>

<p>In ASD, the brain seems unable to balance the senses appropriately. Some
ASD children are oblivious to extreme cold or pain. An ASD child may
fall and break an arm, yet never cry. Another may bash his head against
a wall and not wince, but a light touch may make the child scream with
alarm.</p>

<p><strong>Mental retardation.</strong> Many children with ASD have some degree of
mental impairment. When tested, some areas of ability may be normal,
while others may be especially weak. For example, a child with ASD may
do well on the parts of the test that measure visual skills but earn low
scores on the language subtests.</p>

<p><strong>Seizures.</strong> One in four children with ASD develops seizures, often
starting either in early childhood or adolescence. 4 Seizures, caused by
abnormal electrical activity in the brain, can produce a temporary loss
of consciousness (a “blackout”), a body convulsion, unusual movements,
or staring spells. Sometimes a contributing factor is a lack of sleep or
a high fever. An EEG (electroencephalogram-recording of the electric
currents developed in the brain by means of electrodes applied to the
scalp) can help confirm the seizure’s presence.</p>

<p>In most cases, seizures can be controlled by a number of medicines
called “anticonvulsants.” The dosage of the medication is adjusted
carefully so that the least possible amount of medication will be used
to be effective.</p>

<p><strong>Fragile X syndrome.</strong> This disorder is the most common inherited form
of mental retardation. It was so named because one part of the X
chromosome has a defective piece that appears pinched and fragile when
under a microscope. Fragile X syndrome affects about two to five percent
of people with ASD. It is important to have a child with ASD checked for
Fragile X, especially if the parents are considering having another
child. For an unknown reason, if a child with ASD also has Fragile X,
there is a one-in-two chance that boys born to the same parents will
have the syndrome. 5 Other members of the family who may be
contemplating having a child may also wish to be checked for the
syndrome.</p>

<p><strong>Tuberous Sclerosis.</strong> Tuberous sclerosis is a rare genetic disorder
that causes benign tumors to grow in the brain as well as in other vital
organs. It has a consistently strong association with ASD. One to 4
percent of people with ASD also have tuberous sclerosis. 6</p>
