    <h2 id="the-diagnosis-of-autism-spectrum-disorders">The Diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorders</h2>

<p>Although there are many concerns about labeling a young child with an
ASD, the earlier the diagnosis of ASD is made, the earlier needed
interventions can begin. Evidence over the last 15 years indicates that
intensive early intervention in optimal educational settings for at
least 2 years during the preschool years results in improved outcomes in
most young children with ASD. 2</p>

<p><strong>In evaluating a child, clinicians rely on behavioral characteristics
to make a diagnosis.</strong> Some of the characteristic behaviors of ASD may
be apparent in the first few months of a child’s life, or they may
appear at any time during the early years. For the diagnosis, problems
in at least one of the areas of communication, socialization, or
restricted behavior must be present before the age of 3. The diagnosis
requires a two-stage process. The first stage involves developmental
screening during “well child” check-ups; the second stage entails a
comprehensive evaluation by a multidisciplinary team. 7</p>

<p><strong>Screening</strong></p>

<p>A “well child” check-up should include a developmental screening test.
If your child’s pediatrician does not routinely check your child with
such a test, ask that it be done. Your own observations and concerns
about your child’s development will be essential in helping to screen
your child. 7 Reviewing family videotapes, photos, and baby albums can
help parents remember when each behavior was first noticed and when the
child reached certain developmental milestones.</p>

<p><strong>Several screening instruments have been developed</strong> to quickly gather
information about a child’s social and communicative development within
medical settings. Among them are the Checklist of Autism in Toddlers
(CHAT), 8 the modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers (M-CHAT), 9 the
Screening Tool for Autism in Two-Year-Olds (STAT), 10 and the Social
Communication Questionnaire (SCQ) 11 (for children 4 years of age and
older).</p>

<p>Some screening instruments rely solely on parent responses to a
questionnaire, and some rely on a combination of parent report and
observation. Key items on these instruments that appear to differentiate
children with autism from other groups before the age of 2 include
pointing and pretend play. Screening instruments do not provide
individual diagnosis but serve to assess the need for referral for
possible diagnosis of ASD. These screening methods may not identify
children with mild ASD, such as those with high-functioning autism or
Asperger syndrome.</p>

<p>During the last few years, screening instruments have been devised to
screen for Asperger syndrome and higher functioning autism. The Autism
Spectrum Screening Questionnaire (ASSQ), 12 the Australian Scale for
Asperger’s Syndrome, 13 and the most recent, the Childhood Asperger
Syndrome Test (CAST), 14 are some of the instruments that are reliable
for identification of school-age children with Asperger syndrome or
higher functioning autism. These tools concentrate on social and
behavioral impairments in children without significant language delay.</p>

<p>If, following the screening process or during a routine “well child”
check-up, your child’s doctor sees any of the possible indicators of
ASD, further evaluation is indicated.</p>

<p><strong>Comprehensive Diagnostic Evaluation</strong></p>

<p>The second stage of diagnosis must be comprehensive in order to
accurately rule in or rule out an ASD or other developmental problem.
This evaluation may be done by a multidisciplinary team that includes a
psychologist, a neurologist, a psychiatrist, a speech therapist, or
other professionals who diagnose children with ASD.</p>

<p><strong>Because ASD’s are complex disorders and may involve other neurological
or genetic problems, a comprehensive evaluation should entail neurologic
and genetic assessment, along with in-depth cognitive and language
testing.</strong> 7 In addition, measures developed specifically for diagnosing
autism are often used. These include the <strong>Autism Diagnosis
Interview-Revised (ADI-R)</strong>15 and the <strong>Autism Diagnostic Observation
Schedule (ADOS-G)</strong>.16  The ADI-R is a structured interview that
contains over 100 items and is conducted with a caregiver. It consists
of four main factors-the child’s communication, social interaction,
repetitive behaviors, and age-of-onset symptoms. The ADOS-G is an
observational measure used to “press” for socio-communicative behaviors
that are often delayed, abnormal, or absent in children with ASD.</p>

<p>Still another instrument often used by professionals is the <strong>Childhood
Autism Rating Scale (CARS)</strong>.17 It aids in evaluating the child’s body
movements, adaptation to change, listening response, verbal
communication, and relationship to people. It is suitable for use with
children over 2 years of age. The examiner observes the child and also
obtains relevant information from the parents. The child’s behavior is
rated on a scale based on deviation from the typical behavior of
children of the same age.</p>

<p>Two other tests that should be used to assess any child with a
developmental delay are a formal <strong>audiologic hearing evaluation</strong> and a
<strong>lead screening</strong>. Although some hearing loss can co-occur with ASD,
some children with ASD may be incorrectly thought to have such a loss.
In addition, if the child has suffered from an ear infection, transient
hearing loss can occur. Lead screening is essential for children who
remain for a long period of time in the oral-motor stage in which they
put any and everything into their mouths. Children with an autistic
disorder usually have elevated blood lead levels. 7</p>

<p>Customarily, an expert diagnostic team has the responsibility of
thoroughly evaluating the child, assessing the child’s unique strengths
and weaknesses, and determining a formal diagnosis. The team will then
meet with the parents to explain the results of the evaluation.</p>

<p>Although parents may have been aware that something was not “quite
right” with their child, when the diagnosis is given, it is a
devastating blow. At such a time, it is hard to stay focused on asking
questions. But while members of the evaluation team are together is the
best opportunity the parents will have to ask questions and get
recommendations on what further steps they should take for their child.
Learning as much as possible at this meeting is very important, but it
is helpful to leave this meeting with the name or names of professionals
who can be contacted if the parents have further questions.</p>

<p><strong>Available Aids</strong></p>

<p>When your child has been evaluated and diagnosed with an autism spectrum
disorder, you may feel inadequate to help your child develop to the
fullest extent of his or her ability. As you begin to look at treatment
options and at the types of aid available for a child with a disability,
you will find out that there is help for you. It is going to be
difficult to learn and remember everything you need to know about the
resources that will be most helpful. Write down everything. If you keep
a notebook, you will have a foolproof method of recalling information.
Keep a record of the doctors’ reports and the evaluation your child has
been given so that his or her eligibility for special programs will be
documented. Learn everything you can about special programs for your
child; the more you know, the more effectively you can advocate.</p>

<p><strong>For every child eligible for special programs, each state guarantees
special education and related services.</strong> The Individuals with
Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) is a Federally mandated program that
assures a free and appropriate public education for children with
diagnosed learning deficits. Usually children are placed in public
schools and the school district pays for all necessary services. These
will include, as needed, services by a speech therapist, occupational
therapist, school psychologist, social worker, school nurse, or aide.</p>

<p><strong>By law, the public schools must prepare and carry out a set of
instruction goals, or specific skills, for every child in a special
education program.</strong> The list of skills is known as the child’s
Individualized Education Program (IEP). The IEP is an agreement between
the school and the family on the child’s goals. When your child’s IEP is
developed, you will be asked to attend the meeting. There will be
several people at this meeting, including a special education teacher, a
representative of the public schools who is knowledgeable about the
program, other individuals invited by the school or by you (you may want
to bring a relative, a child care provider, or a supportive close friend
who knows your child well). Parents play an important part in creating
the program, as they know their child and his or her needs best. Once
your child’s IEP is developed, a meeting is scheduled once a year to
review your child’s progress and to make any alterations to reflect his
or her changing needs.</p>

<p><strong>If your child is under 3 years of age and has special needs, he or she
should be eligible for an early intervention program; this program is
available in every state.</strong> Each state decides which agency will be the
lead agency in the early intervention program. The early intervention
services are provided by workers qualified to care for toddlers with
disabilities and are usually in the child’s home or a place familiar to
the child. The services provided are written into an Individualized
Family Service Plan (IFSP) that is reviewed at least once every 6
months. The plan will describe services that will be provided to the
child, but will also describe services for parents to help them in daily
activities with their child and for siblings to help them adjust to
having a brother or sister with ASD.</p>

<p>There is a list of resources at the back of the brochure that will be
helpful to you as you look for programs for your child.</p>

<p><strong>Treatment Options</strong></p>

<p>There is no single best treatment package for all children with ASD. One
point that most professionals agree on is that early intervention is
important; another is that most individuals with ASD respond well to
highly structured, specialized programs.</p>

<p><strong>Before you make decisions on your child’s treatment, you will want to
gather information about the various options available.</strong> Learn as much
as you can, look at all the options, and make your decision on your
child’s treatment based on your child’s needs. You may want to visit
public schools in your area to see the type of program they offer to
special needs children.</p>

<p>Guidelines used by the Autism Society of America include the following
questions parents can ask about potential treatments:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Will the treatment result in harm to my child?</li>
  <li>How will failure of the treatment affect my child and family?</li>
  <li>Has the treatment been validated scientifically?</li>
  <li>Are there assessment procedures specified?</li>
  <li>How will the treatment be integrated into my child’s current
program? Do not become so infatuated with a given treatment that
functional curriculum, vocational life, and social skills are ignored.</li>
</ul>

<p>The National Institute of Mental Health suggests a list of questions
parents can ask when planning for their child:</p>

<ul>
  <li>How successful has the program been for other children?</li>
  <li>How many children have gone on to placement in a regular school and
how have they performed? * Do staff members have training and
experience in working with children and adolescents with autism?</li>
  <li>How are activities planned and organized?</li>
  <li>Are there predictable daily schedules and routines?</li>
  <li>How much individual attention will my child receive?</li>
  <li>How is progress measured? Will my child’s behavior be closely
observed and recorded?</li>
  <li>Will my child be given tasks and rewards that are personally
motivating?</li>
  <li>Is the environment designed to minimize distractions?</li>
  <li>Will the program prepare me to continue the therapy at home?</li>
  <li>What is the cost, time commitment, and location of the program?</li>
</ul>

<p>Among the many methods available for treatment and education of people
with autism, applied behavior analysis (ABA) has become widely accepted
as an effective treatment. Mental Health: A Report of the Surgeon
General states, “Thirty years of research demonstrated the efficacy of
applied behavioral methods in reducing inappropriate behavior and in
increasing communication, learning, and appropriate social behavior.” 18
The basic research done by Ivar Lovaas and his colleagues at the
University of California, Los Angeles, calling for an intensive,
one-on-one child-teacher interaction for 40 hours a week, laid a
foundation for other educators and researchers in the search for further
effective early interventions to help those with ASD attain their
potential. The goal of behavioral management is to reinforce desirable
behaviors and reduce undesirable ones. 19, 20</p>

<p><strong>An effective treatment program will build on the child’s interests,
offer a predictable schedule, teach tasks as a series of simple steps,
actively engage the child’s attention in highly structured activities,
and provide regular reinforcement of behavior.</strong> Parental involvement
has emerged as a major factor in treatment success. Parents work with
teachers and therapists to identify the behaviors to be changed and the
skills to be taught. Recognizing that parents are the child’s earliest
teachers, more programs are beginning to train parents to continue the
therapy at home.</p>

<p>As soon as a child’s disability has been identified, instruction should
begin. Effective programs will teach early communication and social
interaction skills. In children younger than 3 years, appropriate
interventions usually take place in the home or a child care center.
These interventions target specific deficits in learning, language,
imitation, attention, motivation, compliance, and initiative of
interaction. Included are behavioral methods, communication,
occupational and physical therapy along with social play interventions.
Often the day will begin with a physical activity to help develop
coordination and body awareness; children string beads, piece puzzles
together, paint, and participate in other motor skills activities. At
snack time the teacher encourages social interaction and models how to
use language to ask for more juice. The children learn by doing. Working
with the children are students, behavioral therapists, and parents who
have received extensive training. In teaching the children, positive
reinforcement is used. 21</p>

<p><strong>Children older than 3 years usually have school-based, individualized,
special education.</strong> The child may be in a segregated class with other
autistic children or in an integrated class with children without
disabilities for at least part of the day. Different localities may use
differing methods but all should provide a structure that will help the
children learn social skills and functional communication. In these
programs, teachers often involve the parents, giving useful advice in
how to help their child use the skills or behaviors learned at school
when they are at home. 22</p>

<p>In elementary school, the child should receive help in any skill area
that is delayed and, at the same time, be encouraged to grow in his or
her areas of strength. Ideally, the curriculum should be adapted to the
individual child’s needs. Many schools today have an inclusion program
in which the child is in a regular classroom for most of the day, with
special instruction for a part of the day. This instruction should
include such skills as learning how to act in social situations and in
making friends. Although higher-functioning children may be able to
handle academic work, they too need help to organize tasks and avoid
distractions.</p>

<p>During middle and high school years, instruction will begin to address
such practical matters as work, community living, and recreational
activities. This should include work experience, using public
transportation, and learning skills that will be important in community
living. 23</p>

<p>All through your child’s school years, you will want to be an active
participant in his or her education program. Collaboration between
parents and educators is essential in evaluating your child’s progress.</p>

<p><strong>The Adolescent Years</strong></p>

<p>Adolescence is a time of stress and confusion; and it is no less so for
teenagers with autism. Like all children, they need help in dealing with
their budding sexuality. While some behaviors improve during the teenage
years, some get worse. Increased autistic or aggressive behavior may be
one way some teens express their newfound tension and confusion.</p>

<p><strong>The teenage years are also a time when children become more socially
sensitive.</strong> At the age that most teenagers are concerned with acne,
popularity, grades, and dates, teens with autism may become painfully
aware that they are different from their peers. They may notice that
they lack friends. And unlike their schoolmates, they aren’t dating or
planning for a career. For some, the sadness that comes with such
realization motivates them to learn new behaviors and acquire better
social skills.</p>

<p><strong>Dietary and Other Interventions</strong></p>

<p>In an effort to do everything possible to help their children, many
parents continually seek new treatments. Some treatments are developed
by reputable therapists or by parents of a child with ASD. Although an
unproven treatment may help one child, it may not prove beneficial to
another. To be accepted as a proven treatment, the treatment should
undergo clinical trials, preferably randomized, double-blind trials,
that would allow for a comparison between treatment and no treatment.
Following are some of the interventions that have been reported to have
been helpful to some children but whose efficacy or safety has not been
proven.</p>

<p>Dietary interventions are based on the idea that 1) food allergies cause
symptoms of autism, and 2) an insufficiency of a specific vitamin or
mineral may cause some autistic symptoms. If parents decide to try for a
given period of time a special diet, they should be sure that the
child’s nutritional status is measured carefully.</p>

<p><strong>A diet that some parents have found was helpful to their autistic
child is a gluten-free, casein-free diet.</strong> Gluten is a casein-like
substance that is found in the seeds of various cereal plants-wheat,
oat, rye, and barley. Casein is the principal protein in milk. Since
gluten and milk are found in many of the foods we eat, following a
gluten-free, casein-free diet is difficult.</p>

<p><strong>A supplement that some parents feel is beneficial for an autistic
child is Vitamin B6, taken with magnesium</strong> (which makes the vitamin
effective). The result of research studies is mixed; some children
respond positively, some negatively, some not at all or very little. 4</p>

<p>In the search for treatment for autism, there has been discussion in the
last few years about the use of secretin, a substance approved by the
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for a single dose normally given to
aid in diagnosis of a gastrointestinal problem. Anecdotal reports have
shown improvement in autism symptoms, including sleep patterns, eye
contact, language skills, and alertness. Several clinical trials
conducted in the last few years have found no significant improvements
in symptoms between patients who received secretin and those who
received a placebo. 24</p>
